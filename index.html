                    <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                       Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs,
                        chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                      Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. 
                      Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat,
                       with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
                      
                      The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries,
                       chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques.
                        The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

                    <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]

                      Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
                       while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. 
                       The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, 
                       glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE,
                        commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters).
                        Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings.
                       The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

                    <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, 
                      accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, 
                      but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).

                      Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
                       It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.
                        It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
                      
                      Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish,
                       or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
